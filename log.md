## Log

## 2026-02-13 23:43 EST (Codex)
- Area: project bootstrap
- Status: Initialized Cheney project documentation scaffold with README, repo AGENTS policy, inventory contract/files, and first migration runbook.
- Evidence: Created directories `inventory/`, `runbooks/`, `scripts/`, `configs/`, `notes/` and authored core markdown files per bootstrap plan.
- Next action: Populate hardware/VM/network `TBD` fields from live host and Proxmox data.

## 2026-02-14 00:11 EST (Codex)
- Area: inventory pass from live systems
- Status: Replaced major `TBD` fields using live Proxmox data from `rb1-pve`, added VM inventory rows, added dock/peripheral inventory, and drafted network layout file with switch-role planning.
- Evidence: Collected `qm list`, `qm config 100/101`, guest-agent IPs, host CPU/RAM/storage, `ethtool` Wake-on capability, and verified MBA `192.168.5.66` ping + TCP/22 reachability; SSH auth to MBA failed in batch mode.
- Next action: Gain shell access on MBA and bring `rb14-2015` online to replace remaining unverified hardware/network fields and resolve legacy quorum state.
